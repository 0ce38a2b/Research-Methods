# Research-Methods
## What is science?
&ensp;&ensp;It is a systematically organized body of knowledge an a particular subject.Engineering is a constructive science: it studies how to design and construct artifacts, both physical and logical.
## What is research and scientific research?
&ensp;&ensp;Research aims at producing new knowledge.It is largely driven by human curiosity.The motivation to push knowledge beyond the boundary of what is currently know, is intrinsic in human nature and has led humans to dominate the world.
- It is something like finding out stuff and telling people about it.It is identifying a topic or a subject that perhaps has not been explored sufficiently well in your opinion.
- It is the creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge and to devise new applications of available knowledge.
- Its goal is to produce science.(discovery and dissemination of new knowledge)
## What is a good research?
Three attributes:
1. Originality 
2. Significance: the results exert an influence
3. Rigor: the intellectual integrity of the research process and the way the results are demonstrated(i.e for theoretical research, this may refer to the rigor of the mathematical formalization)
- Has to address something of significance, some issue, problem that relates to the interests of a broad community of scholars that arises in the real world or arises in the context of theories and the framework
- Researchable(Something that you can answer by doing research)
- Address a question that hasn't been definitively answered

## Scientific research and thchnological research
## (Basic research and applied research)
- Basic research: research performed without thought of practical ends
 This contributes to knowledge and is only driven by curiosuty.
- Applied research: problem-driven and more predictable
 Its goal is to deliver potentially practical results. 
 
 ## Research, innovation, and public engagement
&ensp;&ensp;The myth of the Ivory tower, where researchers work in isolation from facts and practicalities on abstruse theories and in secluded laboratories is far from reality. The real world is the source of the problems investigated by researchers and their results are transferred to the world in terms of new knowledge and innovations.Because the results of their scientific work can change the world, researchers need to engage with the society in discussing goals and directions and setting priorities.         
&ensp;&ensp;Researchers must be ready not only to address the challenges of difficult technical problems, but also by ethical problems raised by the potential effects of their research.

## Introduction to research methodology
&ensp;&ensp; Methods are systematic actionable principles that can guide humans in accomplishing tasks.Scientific methods provide guidance to achieve scientific research results.We will investigate the two primitive logic inferences used by researchers:
- Deduction
- Induction        
    
&ensp;&ensp;By using mathematical logic, we show the intrinsic differences in the two logic mechanisms, which lead to the fundamental distinction between demonstrable proofs and  disprovable conjectures, which are at the heart of the scientific methods.
Then we will discuss the limits of discoveries.The solutions to research problems are often only approximate solutions that work and are accepted only until better solutions are found.        
&ensp;&ensp; ***Validation is an essential component of research methods.Validation assesses a given result, compares a result against others, and shows how a result may be improved.***
